How many bags of hot Cheetos would it take to end you? Bag one. Easy work. The crunch is good and the heat is low. Your stomach handles the first batch with no problem. You lick the red dust off your fingers and want more. Bag five. The salt starts to pile up. Your mouth feels dry and your tongue starts to swell. You grab some water to wash the dust away. Bag 15. The spice is stuck in your throat and burning acid starts bubbling [music] up. It doesn't taste good anymore. Now it just hurts. Bag 30. The heat is attacking your insides. Your stomach walls are angry. You get sharp, deep cramps and can't sit still. Bag 50. Your body wants to throw it all up and you're dizzy. The red dye is everywhere inside [music] you now. Bag 80. Your kidneys are struggling to filter and are shutting down. You start bleeding inside and the blood mixes with the spice. You sit in pain, totally dry, confused, and burning up. Bag 100. All the carbs put you in a food coma. Your heart is pounding out of your chest. [music] It is too much salt. You try to scream, but your throat is swollen shut. Bag 121.

How many levels of spicy can you survive? Level one, the jalapeno. It starts with a little zap. Your tongue feels warm like licking a 9volt battery. A tiny bit of sweat, but you are totally fine. Level two, cayenne pepper. Now the heat wakes you up. The oils coat your throat and trigger a cough reflex. Your eyes water and your nose starts to run instantly. Level three, the habanero. This is where [music] it stops being fun. Your stomach lining gets irritated and turns angry red. The spice hits your diaphragm and you get violent hiccups. Level four, the ghost pepper. [music] Your brain thinks you are on fire. Your nerve endings scream for help, sending panic signals. You start to drool uncontrollably to try and cool the burn. Level five, the Carolina Reaper. It feels like swallowing lava. Your intestines cramp up tightly to push the poison out. If you make the mistake of rubbing your eyes, it burns with [music] excruciating pain. The shock is so overwhelming you might actually pass out. Level six, pure capsin [music] crystal. This is not food. It is a weapon. It burns chemical blisters all the way down your esophagus. Your body goes into total shutdown.

TRANSCRIPT:
What would happen if you stopped blinking [music] for 1 minute? The urge becomes unbearable. Your tear ducts panic and flood your eyes with water just to keep them [music] safe. At 10 minutes, that protective layer evaporates into the air. A sharp, stinging burn sets in as the oxygen touches your raw eyeballs. 1 hour in, your eyes turn a deep angry red. Tiny blood vessels swell up and burst from the strain of staying open. 12 hours, dust particles land on your eye, but they are trapped. It feels like someone is rubbing coarse sandpaper directly against your brain. 24 hours, your vision fades into a milky white fog. The cornea, which needs water to live, dries out completely and begins to die. At 48 hours without blinking, the internal fluid in your eyes evaporates and pressure drops to zero. [music] Without that structural support, the eye physically collapses inward and wrinkles like a dried grape. By day three, dangerous bacteria start eating the dry spots. Open soores and painful ulcers form [music] deep inside the tissue, leaking infection. One week in, the damage is now permanent and irreversible. >> [music]

How many Dr. Peppers would it take to end you? At 10 cans, your stomach blows up like a balloon. The carbonation creates huge gas pressure inside your gut. It pushes against your ribs and makes it hard to breathe. [music] At 50 cans, you have eaten 4 1/2 lb of pure sugar. Your blood turns into thick, sticky syrup in your veins, and your kidneys burn as they struggle to filter the sludge. At 100 cans, the sugar rushes to your head and swells your brain. Your brain physically gets bigger and crushes against [music] your skull. A blinding migraine hits you and you can barely think straight. At 150 cans, the caffeine hits your brain like a truck. Your heart starts skipping beats and hammers against your chest. You can't stop your hands from shaking violently. At 200 cans, your blood pressure is so high your eyes pop. The tiny vessels in your eyes burst and fill your vision with red. You go temporarily blind and start panicking in the dark. At 250 cans, the phosphoric acid dissolves your insides. It sucks the calcium right out of your bones. Your bones become soft and can barely hold you up. At 303 cans, you reach the lethal caffeine limit. Your nervous system fries and causes a massive glitch.
